## Migration from training repo

Moved project management artifacts from `wolfsbit-01` (training repo) to this repo (app repo) to reduce context confusion when working on iOS development.

### What moved here

**Beads (`.beads/`):**
- Issue tracking now lives with the app code
- Removed beads git hooks from training repo

**Journals (`docs/journals/`):**
- 2026-01-02.md
- 2026-01-03.md
- 2026-01-07.md

**iOS Plans:**
- `docs/plans/ios-04-gguf-integration.md` (active)
- `docs/plans/ios-05-telemetry.md` (active)
- `docs/plans/archive/ios-01-ui-redesign.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/ios-02-coredata-migration.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/ios-03-localization.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/model-download.md`

### What stayed in training repo

- `docs/plans/archive/2025-12-05-jsonl-editor-design.md` (training tool)
- All ML training code and documentation

### Rationale

Active development is now focused on the iOS app. Having beads, journals, and plans in the training repo caused confusion about where to track work and document sessions.
