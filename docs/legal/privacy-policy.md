# Privacy Policy

**Wolfsbit** ("the App") is a chronic illness journaling app. This policy explains how your data is handled.

## Data We Collect

### Health Journal Entries
The App collects health information you voluntarily enter:
- How you're feeling (text)
- Pain levels (1-10 scale)
- Symptoms and notes

**This data is stored locally on your device only.** We do not have access to your health entries, and they are never transmitted to our servers.

### Analytics (Anonymous)
We use TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous usage statistics:
- App opens and feature usage
- Device type and iOS version
- Crash reports

TelemetryDeck is privacy-focused and does not collect personal identifiers. No IP addresses are stored. Learn more at [telemetrydeck.com/privacy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy).

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone)
- Location data
- Contacts or photos
- Health data from HealthKit

## Data Storage

All health journal entries are stored locally on your device using iOS Core Data. If you delete the App, your data is permanently deleted.

We do not offer cloud backup or sync. Your data stays on your device.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer your health data to third parties. Anonymous analytics data is processed by TelemetryDeck under their privacy policy.

## Your Rights

Since all health data is stored locally on your device:
- **Access:** View your data anytime in the App
- **Delete:** Delete individual entries or uninstall the App to remove all data
- **Export:** [Coming soon]
