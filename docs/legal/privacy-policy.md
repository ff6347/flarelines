# Privacy Policy

**Flareline** ("the App") is a chronic illness journaling app developed as part of academic research for a master's thesis. This is a non-commercial project focused on exploring AI-assisted health journaling.

This policy explains how your data is handled.

**Last updated:** January 2026

## Data We Collect

### Health Journal Entries
The App collects health information you voluntarily enter:
- How you're feeling (text)
- Wellness scores (0-3 scale)

**By default, this data is stored locally on your device only.** We do not have access to your health entries unless you explicitly opt in to data contribution (see below).

### Analytics (Anonymous)
We use TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous usage statistics:
- App opens and feature usage
- Device type and iOS version
- Crash reports

TelemetryDeck is privacy-focused and does not collect personal identifiers. No IP addresses are stored. Learn more at [telemetrydeck.com/privacy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy).

### Data Contribution (Opt-In)

You may choose to contribute your journal entries to help improve the AI scoring model. This is entirely optional and disabled by default.

**If you opt in, we collect:**
- Your journal entry text
- The AI-predicted wellness score
- Your self-reported wellness score

**We do NOT collect:**
- Your name or any personal identifiers
- Timestamps or dates
- Device information
- Any other metadata

This data is used solely for academic research and improving the AI model. You can disable data contribution at any time in Settings.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identifiers (name, email, phone)
- Location data
- Contacts or photos
- Health data from HealthKit

## Data Storage

All health journal entries are stored locally on your device using iOS Core Data. If you delete the App, your data is permanently deleted.

We do not offer cloud backup or sync. Your data stays on your device.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. We do not share your data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

**If you opt in to data contribution:**
- Your anonymized entries (text + scores only) are transmitted to our research servers
- This data is used exclusively for academic research and model improvement
- No personal identifiers are ever transmitted

**Analytics:** Anonymous usage statistics are processed by TelemetryDeck under their [privacy policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy).

## Your Rights

**Local data:**
- **Access:** View your data anytime in the App
- **Delete:** Delete individual entries or uninstall the App to remove all data
- **Export:** Export your data as CSV via Settings

**Data contribution:**
- **Opt out:** Disable data contribution at any time in Settings
- **Note:** Previously contributed data cannot be retroactively removed as it contains no identifiers linking it to you
